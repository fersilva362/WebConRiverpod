# GoRouter + Riverpod integration
This web site contains a simple example on how to integrate GoRouter and Riverpod altogether. 
This example is Web app  that on scrolling changes the nav item and strives to represent a Web Ui Design Template  based on Flutter an inspired in this site. 

## The example,[CoworkingSpace](resilient-kelpie-550e38)
### Here's what happens when you run the app: 
- You find a responsive Web design, respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size and orientation.
- I use GoRouter package to navigate between pages.
- to preserve a piece of state (scroll position) and allows listening to that state I used Riverpod.
- I added an embed video using the WebView package  that allows to display web content.
