This web application contains a simple example on how to integrate GoRouter and Riverpod altogether. This example is a Web app with a navigation bar which has link which scrolls to particular element when is clicked and strives to represent a Web UI Design Template based on Flutter an inspired in this [site](https://workvillenyc.com/coworking-space-meeting-rooms/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwsKqoBhBPEiwALrrqiKVOgtr-jDFszw7aWSQSUxV9zeOnDrfH7C14mny-nyvx4quN8MxTmBoCyZkQAvD_BwE).

## The example,[CoworkingSpace](resilient-kelpie-550e38)
### Here's what happens when you run the app: 
- You find a responsive Web design that responds to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size and orientation.
- I used GoRouter package to navigate between pages.
- To preserve a piece of state (scroll position) and allows listening to that state I used Riverpod.
- I added an embed video using the WebView package that allows to display web content.

### Below, some of the sreenshot of the app
